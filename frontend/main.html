		<button class="button" id="start_button">Start</button>
		<div>
			<h2>Controls</h2>
			<div>
				Orange cells are alive and blue cells are not (and anything not within the grid is assumed unpopulated). Choose a preset configuration of live cells from the dropdown menu or create a new one by clicking the cell grid. The 'Start' button advances (or pauses) the game, and the rules (shown below) are applied at each advancing step.
			</div>
			<h2>Rules</h2>
			<div>
				<b>For a space that is 'populated':</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.</li>
					<li>Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
					<li>Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.</li>
				</ul>
				<b>For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.</li>
				</ul>
